## 🌙 Current Poem

**《卑微的光》 — Light of Humility**
A minimalist blue night poem with ambient piano, where light grows from silence.

> “风经过我，什么也没带走。
> 我仍在原处，低一点，再低一点，直到心底的光能照见自己。”

**《光下的女孩》 — Girl Under the Light**  
A quiet, grounded reflection of transformation — how the roughness of life is softened under divine light,  
where every crack becomes a place for love to enter.  

> “我是长在乡下的女孩，  
> 黝黑、粗糙，皮肤被风吹裂。  
> ……  
> 如今我仍旧是黑黝黝的女孩，  
> 只是更柔软、更安静，更真实。”
